# Covernor

We all know that code coverage is the true test of code quality! Why test at all
unless your coverage is at a full 100%? Amirite?

This is where Covernor comes in. Never again will your test suite let you down.
You write your tests and Covernor will make sure that the needle is pegged at
100% at all times.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'covernor'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install covernor

## Usage

Under no circumstances should you ever consider what you are testing and why;
simply test everything and hope that it all comes together in the end. What
could possibly go wrong?
